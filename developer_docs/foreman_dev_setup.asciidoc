Installing the latest development code:
Foreman uses Bundler to install dependencies and get up and running. This is the preferred way to get Foreman if you want to benefit from the latest improvements. By using the git repository you can also upgrade more easily. You will need to have Bundler installed manually for now (check your distribution repositories, or install it via rubygems).

[[prerequisites]]
== Prerequisites
Foreman will run with the following requirements (aside from rubygem dependencies):

* Ruby 2.7.x
* NodeJS 14
* NPM 6.x
* PostgreSQL 13

It’s recommended to install https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv[rbenv] or https://github.com/rvm/rvm[rvm] to manage ruby, and https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm] to manage node and npm on your system.
Before installing PostgreSQL, check first that you don't already have it installed (by running `rpm -q postgresql`).

You will want to make sure that you have postgresql-devel installed so the database gems can install properly.
Also, you would also need gcc, ruby-devel, libxml-devel, libxslt-devel and libvirt-devel packages.

For Fedora, CentOS or RHEL, you can issue the following commands to install all required packages:
[source, bash]
....
dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" "Development Libraries"
dnf -y install gcc-c++ git ruby ruby-devel rubygems \
    libvirt-devel postgresql-devel openssl-devel \
    libxml2-devel libxslt-devel zlib-devel \
    readline-devel systemd-devel tar libcurl-devel
....

[[Setup]]
== Setting the repository
[source, bash]
....
# On Github create your own fork
git clone https://github.com/{GITHUB_USER}/foreman.git -b develop
cd foreman
cp config/settings.yaml.example config/settings.yaml
cp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml
git remote add upstream git@github.com:theforeman/foreman.git
gem install bundler
bundle install
npm install
....

[[Database]]
== Setting the database
It is important that config/database.yml is set to use the correct database in the “development” block.
Rails (and subsequently Foreman) will use these connection settings under “development” to manage the database it uses and setup the necessary schema.

If the default version of the database.yml file isn't working for you, try editing it with the following:
[source, ruby]
....
development:
 adapter: postgresql
 host: localhost
 username: postgres
 password: password
 pool: 5
 database: foreman_development

test:
 adapter: postgresql
 host: localhost
 username: postgres
 password: password
 pool: 5
 database: foreman_test
....

Set up database schema, precompile assets and locales:
[source, ruby]
....
bundle exec rake db:create # if not already created
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed
....

The db:seed step will print out the default admin password, record this in order to log in later.

The previous commands will create databases only for the development environment, for test environment you need to run also:
[source, ruby]
....
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:migrate
....

[[Running]]
== Running Foreman
In order to run Foreman you can use the following command inside your git repository:
[source, bash]
....
bundle exec foreman start
....

You can also run Foreman in two separate processes - frontend and rails. This way when you need to restart Foreman (for code reload) you don't have to wait for webpack build:
[source, bash]
....
# Rails
bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0 -p 3000

# Frontend
bundle exec foreman start webpack
....

Note: You could also create a .env file which lets you customize your individual working environment variables.
`NOTIFICATIONS_POLLING` and `REDUX_LOGGER` are options that can be set in an .env file (as well as in the cli call).
`REDUX_LOGGER` has a boolean value which controls if Foreman will print each redux call in the web console,
and `NOTIFICATIONS_POLLING` is the notification polling interval in ms.

=== Resetting password
If you can't find your admin user's password, you can update its password from rails console:
[source, ruby]
....
bundle exec rake permissions:reset password=changeme
....

Now you can login with `admin` user and its new password.

=== Seeding mock data
[source, ruby]
....
bundle exec rake seed:forgeries
....

All rake tasks are available with the following command:
[source, ruby]
....
bundle exec rake -T
....

[[ChromeDriver]]
== Installing ChromeDriver
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/[ChromeDriver] is a separate executable that Selenium WebDriver uses to control Chrome. We use ChromeDriver to run the integration tests for Foreman.

[[Forklift]]
== Forklift
https://github.com/theforeman/forklift[Forklift] provides tools to create Foreman+Katello environments for development, testing, and production configurations. Follow the https://github.com/theforeman/forklift/blob/master/docs/vagrant.md[installation guide].
